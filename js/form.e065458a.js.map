精度计算比较浮躁，经历了两个大的阶段（只会在组件初始化时执行一次，后续不再改变）\r\n    <br>\r\n    1. accuracy 值（int）\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>1.1 小于 0 会被忽略，执行剩余步骤（默认）</li>\r\n      <li>1.2 大于 0 直接采用，不执行剩余步骤</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    2. 计算 value 的小数位数\r\n    <br>\r\n    3. 计算 step 的小数位数\r\n    <br>\r\n    4. 比较 2\\3 步的值，取较大的值（较高的精确度）\r\n    <br>\r\n    注意：\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>1. 对于 value 和 step 小数位数只与它们的小数位数相关，与具体的值无关，如 0.1 和 0.5 都会取到一位小数</li>\r\n      <li>2. 当 accuracy 小于 step 的精度时每次点击 加或减按钮，可能得不到想要的精度（值会被四舍五入）</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <hr>\r\n    <div>\r\n      default(accuracy 小于 0, value = 1，step = 1（默认）, 无小数位)\r\n
